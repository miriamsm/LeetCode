# Leetcoding Archive

Welcome to my **Leetcoding Archive**! 🖥️🧩

This repository is a personal log of the LeetCode problems I've solved, organized by programming language. It's a place to track my progress, document solutions, and improve my problem-solving skills, especially in **JavaScript**.

## Repository Structure

- **Folders** are organized by programming language (e.g., `JavaScript`, `Java`).  
- **Files** inside each folder are named according to the problem or topic they solve.  
- Ssolutions are commented and explained to make the logic clear.  

> ⚡ In the future, I might also organize problems by difficulty (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`) for quicker reference.

## Purpose

- 📌 Keep track of LeetCode problems solved  
- 📌 Improve my JavaScript skills by writing clear, well-commented solutions  
- 📌 Maintain a personal reference library for algorithms, data structures, and coding techniques  

## Tech Stack

- **Primary focus:** JavaScript  
- Also includes some solutions in Java  

## How I Use This Repository

1. Solve a problem on LeetCode.  
2. Add the solution to the folder for the corresponding language.  
3. Add comments in the solution to describe the approach, logic, and any tips.  
4. Commit and push changes to maintain an ongoing record of practice.

Keep practicing, keep improving, and enjoy the journey of problem-solving! 🚀
